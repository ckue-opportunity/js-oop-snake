# SNAKE-GAME
This snake game was refactored by Christoph KÃ¼nzler in JavaScript, using OOP principles.

The derived OOP classes and methods were refactored from procedural code, 
see js/snake-original-commented.js, using the original snake game that was 
written by [Gaudenz Raiber](mailto:gaudenzraiber@yahoo.de), following the tutorial 
[HOW TO CODE SNAKE - For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baBq5GAL0_U&t=479s). Thanks Gaudenz!

There are refactoring phase files as follows in this project:
1. Original main js-file from Gaudenz: js/snake-original-commented.js
2. Refactored draft (Chris): js/snake-oop-heavily-commented.js
3. Refactored and tidied (Chris): js/snake-oop.js
4. Refactored (Chris), using the Game controller class: js/snake-oop-game.js
