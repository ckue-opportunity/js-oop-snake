# SNAKE-GAME
This snake game was refactored by Christoph KÃ¼nzler in JavaScript, using OOP principles.

The derived OOP classes and methods were refactored from procedural code, 
see js/snake-original-commented.js, using the original snake game that was 
written by [Gaudenz Raiber](mailto:gaudenzraiber@yahoo.de), following the tutorial 
[HOW TO CODE SNAKE - For Beginners!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baBq5GAL0_U&t=479s). Thanks Gaudenz!
